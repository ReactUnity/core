React Unity is a way to build declarative UI in Unity3D using React. It can be used together with packages like Typescript, redux, i18next, react-router and more.
It also supports a subset of CSS features and Flexbox layout system.

Node is only used while developing and not required in runtime or after the project is built. Following are the minimum recommended versions. Use latest stable versions when possible.

- Node 20
- Unity 2021.3
- TMPro v3

## Installing

**Install via OpenUPM (recommended)**

```
